[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findbot_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "bot_msgs",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "bot_msgs" with any
  of the following names:

    bot_msgsConfig.cmake
    bot_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "bot_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "bot_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "bot_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
